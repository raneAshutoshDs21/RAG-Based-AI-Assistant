Space exploration is the study and discovery of celestial bodies beyond Earth’s atmosphere, including planets, moons, asteroids, and distant galaxies. It began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and expanded through manned missions such as Apollo 11, which landed humans on the Moon in 1969. Modern exploration involves robotic spacecraft, telescopes, and Mars rovers like Perseverance. Organizations such as NASA, ESA, and SpaceX are pushing boundaries to establish human presence on Mars and beyond. Space exploration not only deepens our understanding of the universe but also drives innovations in science, engineering, and technology.
