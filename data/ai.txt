Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and visual perception.
AI systems can be classified as narrow AI, which performs a specific task, or general AI, which can perform any intellectual task a human can. 
Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.
AI is applied in healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and personal assistants like Siri and Alexa.
