Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, weather patterns, and environmental conditions, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions release greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere and raising global temperatures. The consequences include rising sea levels, melting glaciers, severe droughts, and more frequent extreme weather events. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, renewable energy adoption, and sustainable living practices. Governments, scientists, and individuals all play a crucial role in reducing carbon footprints and ensuring a balanced ecosystem for future generations.
